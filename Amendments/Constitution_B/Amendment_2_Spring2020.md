[Decision Log Entry](https://www.notion.so/Proposal-to-Update-Quorum-Requirements-3ab51c9c07294c24b92037743376f0c3)

> A quorum should be defined as 2/3 of membership, whether it's general membership or e-team. If the resulting number is not an perfect integer, quorum should rounded to the nearest integer.

> With regard to elections, it is unreasonable for there to be a full quorum of eligible voters to hold an election. In the past, we have held quorum at 2/3 of general membership even if it was inconsistent with the constitution. Therefore, this amendment seeks to update the constitution to be in line with what is actually being practiced.

> With regards to e-team quorum, the [recent bylaw addition for co-presidents](https://github.com/calblueprint/constitution/pull/13) introduces the potential for fluctuating e-team membership numbers. In order to prevent the need to constantly change the constitution, a 2/3 quorum of e-team membership makes more sense. 

> The changes to Section V and IV.2 is also an update that was not caught in [Amendment 2: Add Vice President of Design](https://github.com/calblueprint/constitution/pull/6).
