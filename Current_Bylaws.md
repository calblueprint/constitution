All reflections will be made public and maintained for future semesters to see.
3. Following the reflection, there will be a club-wide discussion regarding the state of Blueprint, general concerns, and potential directions for future semesters.

## II. MEMBERSHIP

### 1. Inactive Members

1. Members may choose to become inactive at the end of each semester. They may choose to become an active member again at the end of their inactive semester, but this does not guarantee their original role is still available to them (i.e. Director of Operations member goes inactive and Blueprint recruits a new Director of Operations).
2. Members may not choose to become inactive during their first semester in Blueprint unless there are extenuating circumstances. The Executive Committee will be charged with hearing extenuating circumstances. If any member of The Executive Committee agrees with the extenuating circumstance, then the member may go inactive. If The Executive Committee unanimously disagrees with the extenuating circumstance, then the member will be asked to reapply for their respective role during the following semester.

### 2. The Role

1. This will be a temporary change for the semester of Fall 2020 but will also allow the possibility and framework for an amendment if the club sees fit going forward.
